        <p>You’re probably accustomed to thinking of bets as either value or bluff. In this taxonomy, value bets are hands whose value comes from getting called, and bluffs are those whose value comes from getting folds. </p>

        <p>Tools like GTO Wizard and other solvers should not be used to memorize specific strategies. There are simply far too many scenarios to memorize. Instead, these tools are best used to understand big-picture concepts such as stack depth, range advantage, nut advantage, bet sizing, and position.</p>

      <div class="preface">
        <p>The river offers the least complicated strategy of any betting street. With no further cards to come, hand values are fixed and future board coverage is no longer a consideration.</p>

        <p>Our never-ending quest for money and fame leads us to the flop. We open the button, the big blind calls and the dealer throws out three community cards. After a twenty second tank on KT3r, action is kindly checked over to us. Now what?</p>

        <p>As far as rules of thumb go in poker, “check to the raiser” is a pretty good one. The aggressor on the previous street generally has the more polar range and so more incentive to bet, while players who just called the previous street have mostly medium-strength hands and less incentive to grow the pot.</p>

      <div class="preface">
        <p>This is a companion piece to Probe Betting. It stands on its own, but understanding how to play these scenarios from both sides will enhance your overall understanding of the underlying concepts. A “delayed c-bet” means checking the flop as the preflop aggressor, then betting the turn.</p>

        <p>When we think about the best hands to bet in a given situation, we tend to consider how well various candidates will perform when called:<br>- Will they be ahead?<br>- Will they have good prospects for improving?<br>- Will they be good candidates for betting later streets, whether for value or as a bluff?</p>

      <div class="preface">
        <p>Solver charts and presolved solutions do not offer much in the way of explicit guidance for responding to limpers. This is because players are generally not incentivized to limp from any position save the SB, and even when they are, the ranges with which a solver would limp are quite different from those employed by recreational players and sometimes even professionals who didn’t study these spots.</p>
